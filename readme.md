# FE-MGF

I have build a Contact Manager site with React using axios. You can display contacts, add a new contact, edit an existing contact and check number of contacts in each area.

### Important Notes:

You will need to have the back end server running (on localhost:9090) before you run the react site (on localhost:3000) and have Node.js v19.3.0 or later!
Link to the back end repo: [here](https://github.com/Nayem59/BE-MGF)

### Getting started

First clone this repository to your local machine and `cd` into the `tech-test` folder.
Next use `npm install` to install all dependencies.

### Running the site

Please use the following command to run the site on localhost:3000 :

`npm start`
