## MGF Junior Web Developer Exercise

To help applicants showcase their web skills we have devised this short exercise
around contact details. 

Included are a JSON file and an SQL file containing a number of contact records,
(contact data is randomly generated, any similarity with real people is coincidental)
you should use the data for the exercise, it is okay to edit the structure as needed.
